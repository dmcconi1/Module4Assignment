JSON and AJAX practice with Add and Delete data functions

Thia app is designed to allow the user to view a customer list from a database, add a new customer, and delete customers as needed or 
desired.

The user can navigate via drop down menu utilizing copy and paste to capture the Customer ID, which is the primary key identifier.
The user can also use the navigation buttons to flow seamlessly through the list, create, and delete secionts easily since the user will
click buttons to verify and begin the processes in the first place. Button navigation is much more intuitive, so I designed the app to 
account for this and be user-friendly in these regards.
